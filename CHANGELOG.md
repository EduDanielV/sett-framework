# Changelog

All notable changes to the SETT framework are documented here.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-14

### Added
- `SETTExecutor` (`sett/core_ruler/executor.py`) and `Action`
  (`sett/core_ruler/action.py`): the "actions as data" pattern. Agents
  describe real-world side effects (send a message, call an emergency
  API, charge a payment) as data instead of performing them directly.
  Only a handler registered on the `SETTExecutor` — the sole component
  allowed to touch the real client — can execute the effect, and only
  after the `EthicalFilter` approves it.
- `SETTOrchestrator.register_executor()`: wires a `SETTExecutor` to
  universal memory and to every registered agent, order-independent
  (works whether agents are registered before or after the Executor).
- `SETTAgent.submit_action()`: submits an `Action` through the
  registered Executor. Raises `SETTConfigurationError` if no Executor
  or no matching handler is registered — fails closed, not open.
- `examples/with_executor.py`: full demonstration of the Executor
  pattern across four scenarios (approved notification, approved
  emergency dispatch, blocked-before-execution, missing handler).
- `tests/test_executor.py`: 18 new tests covering the Executor,
  `Action`, and `submit_action()` end to end, including the privacy
  contract (RiskProfile values never leak into the audit log) and
  order-independent registration.

### Fixed (0.1.1, folded into this release)
- **Corrected note**: an earlier draft of this changelog claimed
  `sett/__init__.py` was corrupted in the published v0.1.0 package. That
  was inaccurate — the file on GitHub was correct. The corruption was
  present only in a local verification zip generated during this
  changelog's audit process, not in the actual published release. No
  fix was needed for this; noted here only to correct the record.
- `examples/with_ethics.py` crashed with `TypeError` in Scenario 1:
  `AwareContextAnalyzer.analyze()` had a signature that didn't accept
  `risk_profile`/`environmental_context`, which `EthicalFilter` always
  passes. Fixed.
- `emotional_state`, `RiskProfile`, and `EnvironmentalContext` never
  actually reached the `EthicalFilter` in the real orchestrated flow —
  `orchestrator.process()` accepted `emotional_state` but never
  forwarded it to `agent.process()`, and `_publish_to_universal()` /
  `UniversalMemory.update()` never forwarded any of the three risk
  layers either. Every real evaluation silently ran with
  `emotional_state="unknown"` and no `RiskProfile`/`EnvironmentalContext`,
  regardless of what was passed in — only direct calls to
  `filter.evaluate()` (as in the test suite) exercised the full system.
  Fixed via automatic propagation: the orchestrator sets
  `agent._current_emotional_state` / `agent._current_location_id`
  before calling `process()`, and `_publish_to_universal()` reads them
  automatically. No existing agent subclass needs to change.
- Biometric risk detection (`ContextAnalyzer._detect_human_at_risk`)
  only checked `context["health"]["heart_rate_bpm"]` (nested), but
  agents publish flat results (`context["heart_rate_bpm"]`, as in
  `examples/multi_agent.py`) — so dangerous vitals (HR=155,
  temp=39.8°C) were silently evaluated as `ALLOW`. Now checks both
  nested and flat structures.

### Notes
- `propose_action()` (added in 0.1.1) remains available as the
  lightweight, no-setup alternative to `submit_action()` — use it for
  low-stakes side effects; use the Executor pattern for the ones where
  "the developer forgot to gate it" is not an acceptable failure mode.
- `SETTEthicalFilterWarningError` and `SETTMemoryAccessDeniedError`
  remain defined but unused — kept intentionally for future use rather
  than removed; `SETTConfigurationError` gained its first real use in
  this release (missing Executor/handler).
- `PrivateMemory` access restriction remains a Python convention
  (leading underscore), not a runtime-enforced boundary. This is a
  deliberate scope decision, not an oversight — revisit only if a
  concrete exploit path is identified.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-09

Initial public release. Core hierarchy (`SETTOrchestrator` /
`SETTAgent` / `SETTExpert`), dual memory (`PrivateMemory` /
`UniversalMemory`), `EthicalFilter` with three-layer risk evaluation
(`HarmCategory` / `RiskProfile` / `EnvironmentalContext`), LLM adapters
for Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini. 91 tests. Published alongside the
SETT preprint on Zenodo (English, Español, 日本語).
